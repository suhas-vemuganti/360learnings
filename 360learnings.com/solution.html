			<h3 style="color: #21618C;">Our Approach</h3>
			<p>360º Learning has the expertise and experience in building some of the best Corporate Virtual Learning environments in India. And we believe that our approach is our key differentiator, and our passion and belief is the value we bring to the table.  </p>
			<p>Our approach encompasses five important steps that are crucial to building a Virtual Learning Environment.</p>
				
			<ul class="gpoint" >
				<li><strong style="color: #21618C;">Initiate:</strong> We conduct a 360º Needs Analysis and understand the skill gap in the organization, the existing learning culture and its shortcomings.</li>
				<li><strong style="color: #21618C;">Identify:</strong> Our team conducts workshops, discussions etc. to understand and document your needs, identify specific requirements and based on the findings propose a low-cost, low-risk learning solution that is tailored to the needs of your organization.
				<p>We will prioritize learning activity based on the culture of the organization, specify the technical and operational requirements for the new learning initiative and recommend the technology and content based on the need. 360º Learning will also chalk out the roadmap from being a new e-learning initiative to an on-demand Virtual University.</p> </li>
				<li><strong style="color: #21618C;">Build:</strong> We will devise the implementation strategy, the technology implementation, the content development program, platform, functionality, user testing and so on. We will also build a deployment plan and in accordance develop a training and communications plan for learners, instructors, managers and administrators.</li>
				<li><strong style="color: #21618C;">Deploy:</strong> We will deploy the learning environment with smooth information and knowledge transfer and specialized support training for your technical team. We will also help you chalk out an internal marketing plan to introduce your team to the new learning environment, and encourage them to adopt it.</li>
				<li><strong style="color: #21618C;">Adopt:</strong> This phase begins when the users are on the learning environment. We help you through this phase with post-launch activities and at a later date, evaluation tools to measure the performance of the system. We will also review your e-learning plan regularly and help you streamline it and stick to the roadmap as per plan.</li>
